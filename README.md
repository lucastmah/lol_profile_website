# website test
This website displays data based on the inputted summoner name in the search bar from the testpage.html screen. By searching, the page is redirected to summoner.html where the inputted data is handled by javascript which then sends an httprequest to a server with the test.php file. This file grabs all the data from Riot Games API's and returns the information.
